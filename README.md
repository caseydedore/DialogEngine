# DialogEngine
Data driven conversation engine.

This project is intended as a tool to drive interactive conversation and mimic line-by-line dialog between a set number of actors. Conversation flow may include branching and conditionally executed statements. When the user is an actor, multiple options are possible, allowing the user to direct the conversation based on their choices. See [this demo project](https://github.com/caseydedore/DialogEngineConsoleDemo) for an example interactive conversation and dialog data.

The engine can support:
- line-by-line execution of dialog
- multiple dialog options useful for user input
- branching dialog
- multiple actors
- condition tracking
- conditionally executed lines
